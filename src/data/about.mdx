# About me

Hi there! I'm Dicha Z<span class="color-blue-800 underline decoration-dashed decoration-offset-4" title="If you're curious about my username, I took it from my middle name without the first and last letter :p">elianiva</span>n Arkana. I love building software and contributing to open source projects! I've been programming since 2019, mainly about web development.

I was born and raised in Indonesia up until now, though I'd love to be able to try to live abroad. I've been always interested in technology ever since I could remember. I tried to learn programming in 2018 but it didn't work out very well because I didn't understand anything and then gave up, but I tried to learn it again in 2019 and now here I am, working on a bunch of open source projects almost every day (mainly for [Teknologi Umum](https://github.com/teknologi-umum)).

# About this website

This is my personal website where I put some of my posts and showcase some of my projects. Originally, I made this website as a place to keep my "notes" and that's it, but where's the fun in that? I also think it's cool to have your own website where you can do _whatever_ you want with it.

I use [Astro](https://astro.build) + [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) with [UnoCSS](https://github.com/unocss/unocss) to build this website and it is deployed at [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

# Things I do

I'm an undergraduate who codes (mostly) as a hobby, though I want to be a proper software engineer in the future. I mainly code for web-related things such as frontend using React / Next, Svelte(Kit), Solid and likes to explore whatever new-javascript-shiny-things out there. I also occasionally do backend stuff using NodeJS (with Typescript, of course). I'm currently exploring C#/.NET and Flutter to expand my knowledge. You can see some of my works on the [projects page](/project) or go to [my Github profile](https://github.com/elianiva).

I love contributing to open source. I'm currently one of the active maintainers for [Teknologi Umum](https://github.com/teknologi-umum) organisation on Github. It's an Indonesian community that was made because there was no community that is 'general' enough, most of them are limited to a certain topic. I was also actively contributing to the Neovim ecosystem, seems like most people know me because of that. Although I'm not using it as my main editor anymore, hence the word "was".

I write [posts](/posts) about different topics, though I can't say that I write them regularly. Hope you find a thing or two that's useful from them!

# Contact

If you want to reach me out then feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@elianiva_) or Discord @elianiva#7886. You can also [email me](mailto:dicha.arkana03@gmail.com) if you prefer doing that.

Well, I guess that's about it. Thanks for visiting my website and I hope you found something useful here. Have a wonderful day! ツ
