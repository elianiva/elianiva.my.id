# Introduction

As you may or may not know, I love Svelte. I think it's a really good Framework (technically a language but whatever) for building a single page application. Long story short, in October 2020 there's a Svelte Summit in which Rich Harris teased us about Svelte-Kit. It is a new way of building a website using Svelte, it's meant to replace Sapper.

It has been a few months since that summit and it still hasn't been released yet. So, I've run out of my patience, I want to try this cool and new stuff, and so I did. I made a simple website to try it out.

# My Experience

## Project Setup

Since I never tried it out myself nor do I watch someone else try it, I was quite surprised. It broke from the start. I mean, that's what you get from experimental software. It turns out it was caused by the new release of [Snowpack v3][snowpack-v3-link].

Thankfully, the Svelte team is super responsive and fixed it in a couple of days or so. I tried it out and it works.

I was expecting it to be this good but I didn't know that it's _this_ good. So yeah, I'm quite surprised.

By the way, upon installing I was also surprised by this huge message.

## I am Speeeeedd

I never used Snowpack before, man, it is _super fast_. I saw it in action from a video and I know it's fast, but trying it out myself is a different feeling. Starting the dev server is near instant, it only took like 1-2 seconds on my old laptop. I like the direction that we're going with this. [Snowpack][snowpack-link], [Vite][vite-link], and [ESbuild][esbuild-link], they're the future of Web Development ;)

## Hot Module Reloading

This is one of the best features in my opinion. When you change some part of your website, it doesn't do a full reload. It also keeps the state of your application which is great.

When I make my website, I need to give the error message a styling. Without HMR, I would need to either trigger the error every time I changed the CSS or make it to an error state temporarily. Thanks to HMR, I only need to trigger it once and change the style as many times as I want.

## Adapters

Svelte-Kit use this new concept called **adapter**. There are a number of adapters available like [@sveltejs/adapter-node][adapter-node], [@sveltejs/adapter-static][adapter-static], etc.

As their name suggests, they _adapt_ your code to a specific environment. For example, if you use **adapter-node** then it will spit out a code that could be run on a server using Node for SSR. If you use **adapter-static**, it will spit out a static build, similar to `sapper export` if you've used Sapper before.

## Issues

While trying out Svelte-Kit, I found out that Svelte's ESlint plugin doesn't work with Typescript so I couldn't use ESlint for this project. That's just a minor issue though.

# Making A Simple App

## Github Job

I decided to make a simple app that utilises Github Job API. You can view available jobs in form of a card and you can filter based on its name, location, or whether or not it's a full-time job. Here's some screenshot

![preview](/assets/posts/trying-out-sveltekit/preview.webp)
![preview-2](/assets/posts/trying-out-sveltekit/preview-2.webp)

I took the design from [frontendmentor.io][frontend-mentor] and over-simplify it. It's just an experiment so I wouldn't care that much about the design.

It also has a dark mode, by the way, I only took the screenshot of the light mode version.

## I Don't Really Like The Reserved Filename

Right now, Svelte-Kit uses `$layout.svelte` for its layout. I don't like this name, it conflicts with the shell variable. I prefer the old one on sapper which uses `_` instead of `$`.

I thought I was editing a `$layout.svelte` file but I was editing a `.svelte` file instead because ZSH thought `$layout` is a variable name. I need to escape it so it would open a `\$layout.svelte` instead.

Two plugins that I use for my editor which are [telescope.nvim][telescope-nvim] and [nvim-tree.lua][nvim-tree-lua] has an issue with this filename, it doesn't escape it before opening it. So I fixed them both which then made me distracted and doing other stuff instead of finishing this app :p

import Update from "~/components/Update.astro";

<Update date="2021-04-10">

Good news! Since [#1370][underscore-pr-link], SvelteKit uses `__layout.svelte` instead of `$layout.svelte` -- This also applies to the error page.

</Update>

## Server Routes

Github API has CORS protection so I had to make my own proxy server. Thankfully, Svelte-Kit did a great job with this one. I only need to create a file with a suffix of `.json.ts` or `.json.js`.

It's actually the first time I made a server route, but I already knew how it works so it's easy. Though I had to go to Svelte's Discord to find out how to do this in Svelte-Kit.

## Pre-rendering

To load your data before rendering it to a user, you need to export a `preload` function with a `module` context in Sapper. It's pretty much the same in Svelte-Kit. The only difference is the function signature is changed a bit. It's similar to `getInitialProps` or `getServerSideProps` in NextJS.

## Path Alias

At first, I don't know how Snowpack works at all. After a little bit of reading through its documentation, turns out you can make an alias for an import path. I use `#` as my prefix for the import path so I could just do something like `#components/SEO.svelte` instead of typing in the full relative path.

I also did this to `tsconfig.json` so I get that sweet path completion from tsserver.

## Dynamic Pages

For the job detail page, I use the Svelte-Kit dynamic page feature. You would make a file with `[slug].svelte` as its name and you'll have access to the `slug` variable which you can then use to fetch specific data for that page.

The `slug` page could be whatever you want. So if you have `pages/job/[id]`. So if you have `pages/job/[id].svelte` and you go to `/job/foobar`, you'll have `foobar` as the `id` value. In my case, it's a long random ID that I can use to fetch a specific job detail.

Github Job API gave me an HTML string that I could directly use using `@html` in Svelte, I don't think this is harmful since it's Github API after all, but you need to be really careful when using `@html` since it opens a possibility for XSS.

## Loading Feedback

I couldn't figure out how to get the current loading state in Svelte-Kit. I used Sapper `preloading` state in the past for my website but I don't know how to do the same thing in Svelte-Kit.

I added a loading animation when you try to find a job using the search bar but that's it. I took it from [here][spinner-link] and convert it to a Svelte component.

## Dark Mode

The original design has a dark mode, and I'm a big fan of dark mode so, why not implement this just for fun. I've implemented this feature before for my website so it's smooth sailing ;)

I use `localStorage` to store the current theme data and load the state to Svelte's store _before_ the user sees the page so they won't see Flash Of Incorrect Theme or whatever you want to call it by putting the loading mechanism _before_ the HTML body.

# Closing Note

So far, Svelte-Kit lives up to my expectation. I'm really excited to wait for its final stable release. Anyway, [here][gh-job-repo] is the repo if you want to check it out yourself, and thanks for reading this post. Have a wonderful day! ;)
