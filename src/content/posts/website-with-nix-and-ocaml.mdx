Hey!

It has been a while since I've written anything on this blog hahah. It's been about
2 years since my last post, I've been really busy with college and work so I
haven't got much time to write anything (or do anything besides work and college, really).

It's been quite stressful recently since I can't really do what I want to do anymore.
It's just an endless cycle of work and college (which is doing stuff I already know, it gets boring quite fast).
I don't get to write anything interesting, just a bunch of boring stuff and I don't feel like I'm learning something new.
So, I decided to take a break from it and do different things to learn something new.

A while ago, I started to use [Nix](https://nixos.org/) (again) to manage my dependencies. I
like the fact that Nix is declarative and being able to define dependencies, config, etc in a file
making it reproducible. Overall I like Nix a lot, minus the fact that it's using a lot of
storage space since each package (or derivation in Nix lingo) is stored in a separate
directory.

I've used Nix before but I didn't really use it for development environment, I just used it
to manage my dotfiles and packages. This time though, I want to try using it to manage my development
environment. I've also been wanting to try out [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) for a while, so I thought
why not use Nix to manage my OCaml environment, that shouldn't be too hard right?
(inb4 I spent several hours configuring things due to lack of documentation lol)

# Why Nix for development?

> Why can't I just do `sudo dnf install nodejs` and go on with my life? Why this esoteric thing?
> Why can't I just use `docker` and use it to run my development environment?

Well, there are several reasons for that, I'm not going to go into detail about them, but basically,
using Nix to manage your development environment makes it reproducible.
What I mean by that is, if there's someone who wants to contribute, or you want to continue
the development in another machine, you can just do `nix develop` and it will give you
a shell with everything you need to start developing.

For now let's just stick with that, I don't want to go into details about Nix, there's already
a lot of articles and videos out there that explains it much better than me. I've listed
few of them below:

- [Per-Project Development Environments with Nix](https://mtlynch.io/notes/nix-dev-environment/)
- [devenv.sh](https://devenv.sh/) - A wrapper around Nix to make it easier to manage your dev environment
