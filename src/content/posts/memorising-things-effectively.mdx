If you've been learning foreign language for a while, you probably know the struggle: memorising thousands of vocabularies, hundreds of grammar points, and absorbing a bunch of different cultural nuances makes the language alive--all that trying to share space inside your already-packed busy brain!

I've been learning Japanese for a while now, and there are a lot of things that needs to be memorised, especially since Japanese uses a different writing system I grew up with. It's a lot to digest.

Where I from, we simply use Latin alphabet. Using another writing system is just adding another layer on top of the already difficult things--hiragana? katakana? not to mention thousands of kanji???

Funny thing is, I didn't feel this way when I first started learning English. I just _know_ the language one day and used it, like, it kind of just _happened_. I learned it sooo passively I didn't even feel like learning at all.

I've been exposed to English media since I was 4 years old or something. I still remember watching cartoon network for the first time and I didn't understand a single thing, I just kind of guessed what the character are saying.

But Japanese? This one is a whole different beast even though I consumed a lot of Japanese content daily. Despite all those exposure, the language just don't want to just _slip in_ to my brain the same way English did hahah

Anyway, I'm not here to talk about the language itself, but more about exploring _how to memorise_ different things!

It doesn't have to be language, it can be applied to literally anything! It just so happens that language learning is one of my favourite topics to talk about.

## Why We Forget: It's not you, it's your brain

Ever found yourself thinking, _"Why do I keep forgetting this?"_ or maybe the bigger question is: _"How does memory actually work? How do we even manage to memorize anything at all?"_

I am no brain expert or neuroscientist or anything in that field, so don't expect any paper-worthy answer--remember, this is just some random guy's blog where he rambles about stuff inside his head :)

That being said, I've been exploring this topic recently. Understanding how memory works could give us some hints on how we memorise things, and maybe figure out how to game the system a bit--minmaxx the shit out of it.

One thing I found interesting is our brain forget things _on purpose_, it's not a bug, it's a feature! If anything, it's actually doing you a favour, believe it or not.

To not make myself look like I just talking out of my ass, I'll try to give you some references that you can read later on, these are the ones that I used when writing this post.

Let's break them down, shall we?

### How the brain forgets

There are basically multiple ways the brain can forget things, or at least that's what the researcher have learned so far. It's divided it into 2 groups: **Passive Forgetting** and **Active Forgetting**.

#### Passive Forgetting

This is the most common way the brain forgets things. The brain just forget things it deems no longer needed, the memory just decays overtime.

There is this interesting sentence I found from the paper:

> The incidental accumulation across time of similar memory traces that impeded proper retrieval of the wanted one, and changes in the memory's context between acquisition and retrieval that impairs efficient recall

Now that's some proper cognitive psych jargon, but how I understand it is as follows:

- _**Too many similar things causes the brain to forget which one is which**_

    Have you ever had those moments where you go "oh yeah it's... wait, which one was it again?" -- I had that a lot, especially with kanji memorisation because a lot of them are similar, see 待つ、持つ、and 時. They mean different things: _to wait_, _to posses_, and _time_.

    This is called **interference**--memories that are _too similar_ piled up and messes up with each other causing you not able to recall them. Ever found yourself in a situation where you name the file `final.docx`, `final2.docx`, `istg-this-is-the-final.docx`, `final-revision.docx` or something like that?

- _**Changes in situation between acquisition and retrieval**_

    The environment of the time you're trying to recall is _too different_ from the one where you were acquiring them, thus making it a **context-dependent memory**.

    For example, you memorise this kanji in a quite environment of your room, but suddenly you have to recall it on a loud public place, you suddenly feels blank.

    I guess this is also why if you memorise something, and then try to recall it again on the same environment, it's _really_ easy to do. Like having a memory on certain place with a specific scent, you will instantly recall the memory given that exact situation, because you give the brain some _context_ to help it.

There are a bunch of other **Passive Forgetting** that the brain can do, but I'm not going to talk about all of them here since it isn't the main focus of this post. Oh, and feel free to correct me :)

#### Active Forgetting

This is the opposite of passive forgetting. The brain actively forgets things; it actively tries to forget things for several different reasons.

- _**Proactive and Retroactive Forgetting**_

    There are 2 types of interference, namely: **proactive (before acquisition)** where the old memory interfere with the new one, and **retroactive (after acquisition)** where adding new information causing the old memory harder to recall. For example, memorising new kanji causing you to forget the old one.

    The two could accelerate the decay of the memory traces. Our brain has limited space, limited energy, and our biological materials are limited. We can't remember everything so the brain constantly making space.

    This one is still unclear on whether it's categorised as active or passive forgetting, at least that's what I found out. There are some research that says it's part of passive forgetting, and there are other research that says it's part of active forgetting.

- _**Intentional Memory Suppression of Traumatic Events**_

    It's when you intentionally suppress the memory of something traumatic that you've experienced. It's the brain's coping mechanism, and it's common in cases of trauma. The brain _actively works_ to prevent those memories from resurfacing, it prevents us from recalling those painful experiences.

    Have you ever experienced a traumatic event? An accident, a death of a loved one, breaking up with someone, etc. I'm pretty sure we've all been there, and it's painful to remember those events, so we _actively try_ to forget it, even though most of the time it's really hard to do.

    It's like when someone said to you "don't think of an elephant" but you immediately imagined an elephant inside your head, even though the instruction clearly said "don't think"--I know you just did ;)

### How does the brain remember?

Enough about the brain forgetting, let's talk about how the brain remembers things. The brain has several steps in order for it to remember something.

#### 1. Encoding

Wow, such fancy word, but all it means is that the brain take all the relevant parts, convert it into something that it understands. Pay attention, or it won't stick! Ever had any occurence where you forgot someone's name even though they just said it to you? You don't have a bad memory, you just didn't pay attention, whoops! ;)

#### 2. Consolidation

The brain takes the information and _stabilises_ it. It can take some time and can also happen when you sleep. The brain sort of reactivates the memories and rehearses them to itself, so that it remembers!

#### 3. Storage

The brain stores the information in a way that it can be retrieved later. Without going to deep, the brain basically weighs the memories and put relation / connection between them. It's like a graph, where the more you remember, the stronger the connection between the memories. They are not stored in a single place, rather, they're spread out across different regions.

The storage are split into 2 parts, the **short-term memory**--also known as primary or active memory--and the **long-term memory**.

- **Short-term memory** is where the brain stores the information for a short period of time. Researchers believe that it is accessed sequentially, which is why you can recall the fifth number on your phone number only running through the first few digits.

    It can only hold limited amount of information, basically what you're thinking right now. We can turn it into a **long-term memory** if we make an effort for it, such as repetition.

- **Long-term memory** holds stuff for days, years, and sometimes indefinitely! Even crazier, it can potentially stores an unlimited amount of memory, with some researchers questioning if we ever forget anything!

    When you 'forget' something, the memory is still probably there, you just can't find it right now. Our brain contains around 86 billion neurons, and each of those neurons form about a thousand connections with other neurons. Do the math and you'll get more than a trillion connections! It's been estimated to be around 2.5 petabytes (2.5 million gigabytes), more than enough to store everything that has happened to your life :)

    Unlike **short-term memory**, these are not in order. You find them by linking them to various things: feelings, sights, scents, sounds, anything that happens to be in your environment when the memory was made.

    When the memory gets recalled, it goes through a reconsolidation process, during which can alter the memory given there are similar informations to the one being recalled. Therefore, our memories are not infallible or always reliable.

#### 4. Retrieval

When you want to recall the information, the brain will try to find the best match. It's like a search engine, it will look for the most similar memories and return the one that matches the most. But sometimes, it just fails. It's not because the memory doesn't exists, it's just that the brain fails to recall. Hence why you sometimes don't remember your colleague's name but suddenly out of nowhere their name pop up in your mind :)

## How to stop your brain from ghosting you

If you don't want your brain to ghost you, you need to stop it from doing so by
reviewing it *just* before it forgets. If only there was a way to do that...
Kinda like how you charge your phone, you do it when it's low in battery, just before it dies.

Most people just re-read stuff randomly. But what if you could figure out the *exact* best moment to review? The one that gives you the most bang for your buck, memory-wise? It's like minmaxxing your brain. Well you are lucky! Turns out, you can totally minmax your memory, someone figured it out, it's called **Spaced Repetition System**!

### Explain like I'm 5

So, what is Spaced Repetition System and how does it actually work? Okay, so, imagine this scenario:

- be you
- learning a new language, new skills, new concepts, whatever
- cramming it all in, feels good for a moment, feels like you achieved something
- wake up the next morning, poof, half of it is gone
- feelsbad.png
- thinking you're not actually learning anything
- stopped learning because you don't feel motivated anymore

<small class="block -mt-4 mb-4 opacity-50">a bit overexaggerated, but you get the idea :p</small>

Listen, it's not your fault. Our brain just works like that. Totally fine! You can't expect it to instantly remember everything you just learned in a day.

But... what if I tell you that _there is_ a way to fight that forgetting curve? Here's where Spaced Repetition System comes in! Check out this famous Herman Ebbinghaus 'curve of forgetting':

![Ebbinghaus Curve](/assets/posts/memorising-things-effectively/ebbinghaus-curve-plain.png)

Lots of versions out there, but the idea is the same. Your memory of something drops hard after you first learn it. As you can see from the curve, it drops by half after only 20 minutes. It keeps dropping until poof--gone.

SRS fights this. How?

It gets you to review stuff you just learned. But here's the key: it **spaces out** those reviews over time, hence the name *spaced repetition*. You review something after 10 minutes. Then maybe the system tells you to review it again in an hour, then tomorrow, then in two days, then a week, you get the idea.

This simple act of reviewing right before you'd forget it helps lock it into your brain long-term. That's the core idea of SRS.

Compare that previous Ebbinghaus curve with this one:

![Ebbinghaus Curve](/assets/posts/memorising-things-effectively/ebbinghaus-curve-repetition.png)

You can see that the memory maintains its retention because we're recalling it overtime.

## How it feels in practice
(Bring it back to your experience here.)
- “When I review words right before I forget them, they finally click.”
- “It’s like my brain gets trained to recognise what matters.”
- Not about cramming. It’s about timing.

## What Most People Get Wrong
- Re-reading notes ≠ effective.
- Random flashcards with no timing = wasted effort.
- Studying every day isn’t enough if you don’t review smartly.

## The Smart Way to Remember
- Use tools or systems that track what you’re about to forget.
- Show up consistently, review just enough.
- It saves you time, boosts memory, and keeps you sane.

## Wrap-Up / Personal Touch
- “This method helped me stop forgetting words like 猫（ねこ）and actually use them.”
- “If you’re struggling with memory in language learning, the timing of review might be your missing piece.”
- Optional:
        “That’s why I’m building a tool that helps with this (MochiMemo plug?).”
