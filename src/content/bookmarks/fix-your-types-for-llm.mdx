When using agent mode to code, aka vibe coding, in the case of legacy code which has a fuck ton of type errors, you should fix them first, otherwise the LLM will stuck trying to fix the errors over and over wasting your tokens.

The better the type system is, the more efficient the LLM will be. So yeah, pay attention to the types! It will make them work more efficiently and hallucinate less because it knows the context.

Could also use graph memory or something but making your code typesafe is the better option overall, it benefits language server, humans, and the LLM -- and it's a lot easier!
