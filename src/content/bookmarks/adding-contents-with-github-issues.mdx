This idea was proposed by someone I know on Discord where you can just use Github issues to add contents to your blog. The way it works is quite simple, you basically create an issue, add a GHA workflow that will automatically convert that issue into a file and then commit it to the repo. Pretty neat!

This is the first post / test that I'll be using, let's see if it works. (sixth attempt :p)
