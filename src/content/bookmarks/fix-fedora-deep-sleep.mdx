title: Fix Fedora Deep Sleep

My deep sleep was not working when I closed the lid of my laptop since Fedora 40. It was caused by the `mem_sleep` mode
set to `s2idle` instead of `deep`, no idea what changed it, but here's the solution.

Check if the current mode is `s2idle`:

```bash
$ cat /sys/power/mem_sleep
[s2idle] deep
```

To change that to `deep`:

```bash
$ sudo sh -c 'echo deep > /sys/power/mem_sleep'
```

It should now be fixed:

```bash
$ cat /sys/power/mem_sleep
s2idle [deep]
```

Also, add the following to `/etc/default/grub`:

```ini
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="mem_sleep_default=deep"
```

And update grub (you might need to adjust this command to your system):

```bash
$ sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
```
