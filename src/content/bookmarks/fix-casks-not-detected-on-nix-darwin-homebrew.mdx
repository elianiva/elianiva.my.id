Casks were not detected in my installation for some reason, they didn't get moved to ~/Applications. Turns out you need to set them up manually.


This should be located in the `flake.nix` inside nix darwin modules.
```nix
nix-homebrew = {
  enable = true;
  enableRosetta = true;
  user = "elianiva";
  taps = {
    "homebrew/homebrew-core" = homebrew-core;
    "homebrew/homebrew-cask" = homebrew-cask;
    "homebrew/homebrew-bundle" = homebrew-bundle;
  };
  mutableTaps = false;
  autoMigrate = true;
};
```

This is the config inside nix-darwin configuration

```nix
homebrew = {
  enable = true;
  casks = pkgs.callPackage ./casks.nix { };
  caskArgs = {
    appdir = "~/Applications";
    require_sha = true;
  };
  onActivation = {
    cleanup = "zap";
    extraFlags = [ "--verbose" ];
  };
  global = {
    brewfile = true;
  };
};
```

The important part here is setting `appdir` to `~/Applications`. Honestly no idea what `global.brewfile` does but for now it works and I can't be bothered to tinker with it. I spent too much time already.
