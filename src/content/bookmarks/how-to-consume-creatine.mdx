I figured out that it's a lot easier to just mix it with a little bit of water, stir it, and then drink it immediately. No need to add 200ml of water or something like that because this thing ain't going nowhere, it's not getting diluted anytime soon. Mixing it with protein shake is also a good way of consuming it.

The reason why is because when you use the unflavoured one, it feels like you're consuming chalk. I should probably just buy the flavoured one next time. I thought it would tastes like nothing but no it tastes like chalk--not that I ever consumed chalk lol
