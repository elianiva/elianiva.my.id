Roo Code is an open-source, AI-powered coding assistant that runs in VS Code.
It goes beyond simple autocompletion by reading and writing across multiple files, executing commands, and adapting to your workflow—like having a whole dev team right inside your editor.

See [roocode.com](https://roocode.com) for more information.
