Pesto is a Remote Code Execution Engine that lets you execute any piece of code on a remote server via REST API.
It is heavily inspired by Piston. Pesto is not a fork of Piston, it's an entire rewrite from scratch and therefore
it's not compatible with Piston but should be similar if you're already familiar with Piston.

Pesto was written with a fresh start, minimizing the dependencies needed, and system controlled for limited resources usage.
Hence, users will need to register in order to gain access to Pesto's API.

Its landing page is build with Astro. The same technology that powers this website.
