**GH Job** is a simple app that I made when I was trying out Svelte-Kit. It gets its data from Github Job API and display it using a simple card.

You can read more about my thoughts about this app and Svelte-Kit in general [here](/posts/trying-out-sveltekit).

It can filter the result by the title, location, and whether if it's a full-time job or not. It also has dark mode.

It's pretty basic since I only made this for an experimental purpose.
