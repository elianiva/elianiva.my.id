This was made using Java Swing framework for one of my final assignments at school.

It's my first time ever to write a Java GUI app, and I'm not going to lie, I don't really enjoy the process.

Some of them are enjoyable, I learn a few new things about Object Oriented Programming, but some of them are frustrating :)

Anyway, please go to [the readme](https://github.com/elianiva/kasir-java/blob/tugas-akhir/README.md) if you want some more information about this app.
