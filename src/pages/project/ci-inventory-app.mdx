This app was made using [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/). It's for one of my final assignment, just like my [previous app](/project/java-cashier-app)

It's my first *kinda* serious app using PHP. I said *kinda* because I don't like PHP, it's weird and if I could, I wouldn't choose it.

Please go to [the readme](https://github.com/elianiva/ci-inventaris/blob/master/README.md) if you want some more information about this app.
